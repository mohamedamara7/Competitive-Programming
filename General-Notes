-An array or string can be sorted in o(n*logn) or in o(n) using frequency array.
-The number of subsequences is 2^N and the number of subarrays is N*(N+1)/2.

-If we hava a segment [L-R] sometimes we need to store a certain value in it we can loop from l to r but if we have N segments this might take O(N^2) and give TLE.
There's a trick to avoid TLE by putting seg[l]+=val,seg[r+1]+= -val and after the queries we can loop over the full and editing it.
int cnt=0;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
  arr[i]+=cnt;
  cnt+=arr[i];
it's the same as applying prefix sum on the new array.
