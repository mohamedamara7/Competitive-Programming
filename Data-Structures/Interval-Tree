Segment tree data structure solves:
 		Given set of intervals (a-b). Then given set of queries, each query is a number, HOW many intervals contain the number?

Segment tree != Interval Tree

Interval tree data structure solves:
 	Given set of intervals (a-b). Then given set of queries, each query is an interval, HOW many intervals intersect the given interval?
 			If given interval has start = end, then it could solve what Segment tree

Interval tree is extremely efficient in time/memory when moving to higher dimension.
