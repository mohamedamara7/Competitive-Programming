If we need to do a BS search on an array of length=N. we always put l=-1, r=N and itirate over a condition r>l+1.

-If the search space is FFFFTTTT and we need to find the last false and first true.
while(r>l+1)
{
  mid=(l+r)/2;
  if(okey(mid))
    r=mid;
  else
    l=mid;
}
Notes:
1- okey(mid) may be any condition like arr[mid]>=k.
2- r will always point at the first true and l will always point at the last false.
3- r will have values between 0-N. 0 if the search space is TTTT and N if the seach space is FFFF.

-If the search space is TTTTFFFF and we need to find the last true and first false.
while(r>l+1)
{
  mid=(l+r)/2;
  if(okey(mid))
    l=mid;
  else
    r=mid;
}
Notes:
1- okey(mid) may be any condition like arr[mid]>=k.
2- l will always point at the last true and r will always point at the first false.
3- l will have values between 0-N. 0 if the search space is FFFF and N if the seach space is TTTT.
